All data is from the U.S. Census Bureau: https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/oaklandcitycalifornia/PST045217#qf-headnote-b

Data visualized in bar graph form and calculated proportionally with the largest parameter (white) scaled to 100%.

"Other" is the combination of "American Indian and Alaska Native alone" and "Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander alone".

Latin was calculated as 100% - "Black or African American alone" - "American Indian and Alaska Native alone" - "Asian alone" - "Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander alone" - "Two or More Races" - "White alone, not Hispanic or Latino".
